- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wizhodge! 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in VR. I specialize more in Computer Hardware Engineering, but I find that learning software is also a fun time! 
      Right now, I'm working on a Bachelor's degree.
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, C#, and Python. I am also learning Blender software for fun as well.
